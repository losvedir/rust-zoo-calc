Implementation of the `calc` animal in Andrej Bauer's [Progamming Language Zoo](http://andrej.com/plzoo/).

Parsing is done with recursive descent using operator precedence climbing. Based on the
C++ implementation from the [LLVM tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/LangImpl2.html) for an example language.
Inspiration also drawn from this [python implementation](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/08/02/parsing-expressions-by-precedence-climbing).
